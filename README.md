# Easy Button ▶️

Initially I made it to help the open source community and artists who may want alternatives if they don't have the means to invest in tools.
I was inspired by the "Layer Factor" plugin from [Sergey Kritskiy](https://kritskiy.gumroad.com/), but I'm thinking about being a plugin for creating windows with customizable buttons (I'm thinking of a purpose of being useful for different workflows).
